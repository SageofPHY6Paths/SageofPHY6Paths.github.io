# Hello, fellow fools!

SageofPHY6Paths is a mysterious person who knows important things about which most people know frighteningly little.

Check out my websites <a href="https://hinduismdebunked.com/" target="_blank">hinduismdebunked.com</a> and <a href="https://nd.hinduismdebunked.com/" target="_blank">nd.hinduismdebunked.com</a>. The first one is about criticism of Hindu scriptures where as the second one is about an alternative to religions that I started.

> Please don't get offended by the word "fools" given above. These days people get offended so easily. I consider every person as a fool. We can only decrease our foolishness but it will never become zero just like temeperature can never reach absolute zero Kelvin.
