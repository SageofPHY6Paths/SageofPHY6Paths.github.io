After reading the Wikipedia article "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_of_Caste" target="_blank">Annihilation of Caste</a>", I found it interesting that Ambedkar came to a *similar* conclusion as me.

> He argued that inter-caste dining and inter-caste marriage is not sufficient to annihilate the caste system, but that "the real method of breaking up the Caste System was... to destroy the religious notions upon which caste is founded"[5]

Compare this with my own quote from "<a href="https://sage.hinduismdebunked.com/posts/censored-tweets-and-quotes/" target="_blank">Censored tweets and quotes</a>"

> Caste system is like a branch of a tree. If you cut the branch it will again grow. You need to the remove the entire roots of the tree and these roots are nothing but Hinduism.

So, essentially I said that Hinduism must be eradicated for the caste system to be annihilated.

Compare the relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_views_on_slavery" target="_blank">Christianity and slavery</a> to the one between Hinduism and the caste system. The caste system is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India#History" target="_blank">older than Hinduism</a> just like slavery is older than Christianity. The caste system has been present from the time of Indus Valley Civilisation (3300 BCE - 1700 BCE), whereas Hinduism was created after the Indo-Aryan migrations.

> In the eighteenth and nineteenth century debates concerning abolition, passages in the Bible were used by both pro-slavery advocates and abolitionists to support their respective views. 

From the above Wikipedia paragraph, it is clear that Christianity is more or less neutral towards slavery. You can cherry-pick some verses that support it and some that are against it. Christianity never depended on slavery that much, and it can (and in fact did) survive even after the abolition of slavery. Compare this with the fact that Muhammad, the perfect man according to Islam, <a href="https://wikiislam.net/wiki/Qur%27an,_Hadith_and_Scholars:Slavery#Slaves_Owned_by_Muhammad" target="_blank">owned many slaves</a>. Of course, the fact that Christianity survived proves that most humans are fools. If the bible is indeed the morality given by an omnibenevolent being, then he would unambiguously declare that slavery is morally evil, and he would not have a neutral opinion.

But Hinduism doesn't have a neutral opinion on the caste system like Christianity has on slavery. In fact, Hinduism mandates you to be a casteist person. The vast majority of people marry only within their caste. Otherwise, it is considered a sin. I have never seen a temple where the priest is not a Brahmin by birth. So, you can't abolish the caste system without eradicating Hinduism. As long as Hinduism survives, the caste system will also survive. The **real tragedy** is that the majority of the Hindus are of low caste. So, they voluntarily believe that they are inferior people, analogous to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalized_racism" target="_blank">internalized racism</a>.
