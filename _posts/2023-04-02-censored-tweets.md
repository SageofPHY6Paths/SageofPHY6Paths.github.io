Twitter and Reddit permanently banned my accounts previously for saying the below things. Check <a href="https://sage.hinduismdebunked.com/posts/sick-of-censorship/" target="_blank">this</a> for more info.

# Atheism

> If your religion wants me to be a slave to some other fools who believe in this religion, then of course I will disrespect it out of self respect for myself. This religion offends me more than I offend its believers. Context: <a href="https://hinduismdebunked.com/immorality/caste-system/#sb-71115" target="_blank">Srimad Bhagavatam 7.11.15</a> [3:40 PM 路 Dec 31, 2022 路 15 Views]

# Veganism

> Humanity has not yet reached a point where our existence can be considered a positive thing. I hope we can reach that point in few centuries. 1/3 [9:42 PM 路 Dec 31, 2022 路 11 Views]
>
> But as it stands a completely logical being would think it is better to painlessly kill all humans if given such a power. The amount of suffering humans are causing to other sentient beings is enormous. 2/3
>
> As for myself I probably wouldn't do that because I am not a completely logical being. There are still emotions present in me. 3/3

> 2 ways people can find meaning [without religion]:<br>
> 1)Reduce suffering: Fight for the abolishment of animal agriculture. Fight against human trafficking, wars, racism, casteism, inequality etc.<br>
> 2)Pursuit of knowledge:Do research to understand the workings of the universe or to cure diseases etc. 1/2
>
> The cheap meaning to life that you obtain from religion is infinitely inferior to these 2 ways of life. 2/2

> The first tweet given under Atheism and the first thread given under Veganism were my last tweets. They are probably the reasons I was banned.
