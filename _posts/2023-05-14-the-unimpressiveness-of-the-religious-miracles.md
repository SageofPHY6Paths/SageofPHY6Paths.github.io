I have an argument against religions and I expected that it would have already been discussed somewhere and I searched online but couldn't find any resources written by philosophers who talked about this argument seriously.

For example, take Christianity<sup><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>,

1. Christians believe that many miracles<sup><a href="#f2">2</a></sup> mentioned in the bible are **historical facts** and were not made up later by believers.
2. They also believe that Jesus **claimed** that he is [God the Son][1] and he is [united in essence][2] to the real God.
3. From 1. and 2. It follows that his claim is true.

Much has been argued by atheists to show that 1. and 2. are not historical facts and are false. They generally try to argue that the only [two events that are certain][3] are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. They claim that it is not even clear that the Bible contained anything remotely close to what he probably taught.

I want to argue from a different perspective. Let us **assume** that 1. and 2. are indeed historical facts (I actually think that premise 1. is just made up and not true). Does 1. and 2. **imply** 3.?

I think 1. and 2. **will not imply** 3. For example, take [Hagoromo ÅŒtsutsuki][4] from the Naruto franchise. **He resurrected himself 1000 years after his death** to help the protagonists. But he wasn't God of that fictional universe. He was **just an advanced alien species** and he was an expert chakra user. He could destroy continents if he want. Some of his feats are more impressive than Jesus' miracles and yet he is not God. I think to accept a being as God of this universe the miracles we need should be universal level. **If I ever met a being that can destroy all stars in the universe in a second and again rewind time back to before the destruction and this time he won't destroy it, I will believe that he is God**. These are the type of miracles we need to guarantee that a being is God.

I can understand why **2000 years ago** people were so impressed by simple miracle **stories** like resurrection and walking on water that they believed that only God can do that, because back then they didn't know much about the universe. They used to think that Earth and Humans are the center of the universe and sun and moon are small compared to earth and stars are even tinier. **In those times they might sound impressive but after humanity has come this long in our understanding of the universe they are no longer impressive enough to conclude that it must be from the creator of the universe**.

My conclusions:

1. If Jesus' miracles are indeed historical facts (although it's unlikely), then **we can only conclude that [Naturalism][5] is false**.
2. If a God is assumed to be intelligent, then he will not do miracles that can only impress people of a specific time and instead he will do miracles that are so impressive that any future people of that species will not doubt that he is God after confirming that his miracles are historical facts.

**Did any philosopher write something like this in the past? What is the criticism for this argument?**

Also, just because a very powerful being says that it is omnipotent doesn't imply that it is actually omnipotent. See the image below where [Majin Buu](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Majin_Buu) from the Dragon Ball franchise claims to be omnipotent, but he is still defeated by Goku. It just means that, that being never came across something that it was not able to do. Majin Buu was able to cure blind people. Majin Buu was able to convert a whole city of people into candy and ate them. He did several galactic-level feats (much more impressive that any Jesus' miracles). But Goku still defeated him using the spirit bomb. Majin Buu can do everything that Jesus can do and in fact he can do many things far beyond the miracles attributed to Jesus. But Majin Buu never showed anything that made me believe he is the god or he had omnipotence.

<sup><b id="f1">1</b><sub> The argument works for other religions like **Hinduism, Islam** also by changing it slightly. Krishna raising Mount Govardhana on his little finger and Muhammad splitting the Moon are not universal feats.</sub></sup>

<sup><b id="f2">2</b><sub> By miracles I mean anything that cannot be explained by the established scientific laws and we can't generalize the established scientific laws such that the miracle can be explained. For example, if we encounter [Double-slit experiment][6] and think about it using classical mechanics it seems miraculous but we can generalize classical mechanics into [quantum mechanics][7] which can explain it scientifically.</sub></sup>
